### Ideas
Ask some information about the user that can be used for the final sequences.

For example how would you describe yourself: observant, brave, etc.

Add resting, allow the player to rest to recover sanity. Resting will take a turn but will help with certain obstacles that have the potential to eat away at your sanity.

If santity drops below a certain point you have a chance of failing actions, this would make the game more rng based.
